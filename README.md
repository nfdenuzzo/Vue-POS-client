Detailed explaination of the application - This simple PWA will be designed for a restaurant, if you are not sure what a PWA a simple way to describe it would be - it gives users the ability to download the website which will in turn act like a native application opening in a standalone container.

By creating a PWA we can ensure cross platform usability instead of having a dedicated android/iOS application as well as ensuring responsive designs. Users will be able to browser the website as usual viewing the menu, contact numbers, opening times on any platform be it mobile or desktop.

Users will also be able to sign up and login which will enable them to order food, each item will be displayed enabling users to make changes to that specific item if they so wish such as remove toppings or add toppings to a dish if and where appicable. The owner of the resturant would create each item on the website selecting what options are either editable or can be added/removed

Users will then be able create baskets and checkout once they are happy with their orders, upon checkout they will need to specify if the order will be for collection or delievery and based on the specified option a charge could be added to the bill, theses charges are again setup by the owner, users will also be prompted to subscribe to notifications which would come through based on the order status change after they have made their selections they will be redirected to a payment gateway to confirm payment. once payment has been made and confirmed an order will be placed

Admin users will be able to view new orders on their screen, updating these orders as they are process to new stages -> example: Order being prepared -> Order Ready for collection / Order out for delievery. enabling a user to see the status of their order at any given time when on the application

Users will also be able to subscribe to special notifications where in future the owner can post specials and users woudl receive a notification on their phone.
