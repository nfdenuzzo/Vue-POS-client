          PRODUCTS
        </div>
        All products are subject to availability. In most cases, we
        will offer an alternative for any out-of-stock item. We do not use nuts in our products,
        however, some ingredients are produced in factories that handle nuts and
        some ice creams contain nuts. If you have an
        allergy we kindly ask that you do not order online. Instead, please
        telephone us and inform your order-taker directly in full of your allergies. We do have a number of options
        available for vegetarians which are indicated on our menus. We also have
        procedures in place for making pizzas that are suitable for vegetarians
        however please note that we do not have a dedicated preparation or
        cooking area in our stores for vegetarian food. If you are a vegetarian
        please inform your order-taker who will do their best to ensure that any
        risk of cross-contamination with your order is minimised. We have strict
        procedures in place for making pizzas that are suitable for vegans,
        however, please note that we do not have a dedicated preparation or
        cooking area in our stores for vegan food. Great care is taken in
        the preparation of all our products, however, we cannot guarantee that
        all bones from meat products have been removed and some may remain.
        Olives may contain stones. Cooked ham is formed from cured pork legs
        with added water. Ground beef, chicken breast strips and smoked bacon
        rashers contain added water. Some products may have been previously
        frozen. Our pizzas are handmade to order with fresh dough. The images of
        our products contained on our menus and Sites are for illustrative
        purposes only. Although we try our hardest to be consistent, at times,
        the size of the bases can vary and products you order may vary slightly
        from those images. As our pizzas are freshly hand
        made to order, calories on each pizza may vary.

          AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY
        </div>
        We strive to maintain our excellent reputation for on-time delivery.
        However, unfortunately, things do not always go to plan and factors
        outside of our control such as the weather and traffic conditions may
        occasionally prevent us from achieving this. We will
        do their best to fulfil your order by the dynamic delivery and
        collection times displayed to you. However, these timings are estimates
        only and do not guarantee the accuracy of the dynamic
        delivery times. This means that you won’t be entitled to
        cancel your order or claim compensation if your order isn’t fulfilled by
        the dynamic delivery time. Should you be
        unsatisfied with your order you can follow the standard process
        available to all customers and contact our Customer Services team.
        Delivery isn't easy - but we've had a lot of practice
        in getting it right. That's why we don't support the use of third party
        delivery service companies to deliver our food. Trust the experts. We
        like to deliver the pizza ourselves as it allows us to maintain high
        standards and ensure that you are delivered a piping hot pizza. Our
        restaurant will do its best to fulfil your order in accordance with the
        date and time confirmed to you at the time of your order. If your order
        is for delivery we
        will do our best to fulfil your order within a reasonable time of your
        confirmation email, taking into account the volume of orders and
        circumstances facing the restuarant at the time. For a real time update
        of your order, you can click on the Pizza Tracker link provided on the
        confirmation screen. Delivery charges may apply, please ask in store for
        details.
